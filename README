====================================
=  README for ex12: Four In A Row  =
====================================
A Tkinter based GUI implementation of the famous 'Four In A Row' game.
Game is played by running two instances of 'four_in_a_row.py' (either on the same machine or on two machines on the
same network). Instances are run from command line by calling:

python3 four_in_a_row.py <player> <port> <ip>

<player> is either 'human' or 'ai' and configures game mode to be manual or automatic, <port> is the port to
communicate through (maximum 65535, recommended around 8000) and <ip> is the ip address of the machine running
the instance to connect to (first instance is created with no ip argument given, and the second connects to it).

==============
Game implementation includes the following classes:
- FourInARow: The high level application object, handling game events, turn order and legality, communication between
              instances and controlling the objects that manage GUI, gameplay and AI.
- Game:       The object representing the game board, handling current game state, making moves on the board and
              checking for game end conditions.
